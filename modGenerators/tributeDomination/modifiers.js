// Defense fleets will be based on / influenced by:
// - the faction that owns it ( so merchant ships in the area aren't used as defense )
// - fleets in the area ( type of ships that guard it )
// - tribute value ( how many ships guard it )

// Tribute reward will be based on / influenced by:
// - planet attributes ( i.e "paradise" planets will obviously have some dosh)
// - number of links ( more links = more trade routes )
// - owner faction ( some factions will / can pay more or less )
// - mineables in the area ( small increase )
// - trade fleets in the area ( more trade ships must mean it's more profitable? )

// Also, I think I'll lower the required combat rating because you can have a low combat rating and still be considered a serious threat. i.e a merchant captain who decided to sell his merchant ships and buy an army of war ship would be a serious threat to any planet.

// Required combat rating will be based on / influenced by:
// - government ( fixed value for each gov )
// - defense fleet ( multiplier for amount of defense ships )
// - will have a limit so ridiculous combat ratings won't be required.
